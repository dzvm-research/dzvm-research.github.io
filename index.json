Daniel Zeymer von Metnitz, an Ophthalmology resident and researcher at the University Eye Hospital Tübingen, with over 60,000 consultations and 20,000 surgical procedures annually, ranking it among Germany’s largest and most impactful eye clinics.\nAs a member of the Ueffing Lab at the Intitute for Ophthalmic Research of the University of Tübingen, my research focuses on understanding retinal structures and their links to systemic diseases. I focus on medical image analysis, biostatistics and developing predictive models for conditions such as diabetes, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and clinical practice, driving innovation in ophthalmology and digital health innovation.\nBeyond research, I am dedicated to teaching, and serve as a lecturer for biostatistics courses, sharing my expertise to inspire data-driven decision-making in healthcare. My clinical training spans prestigious institutions including Charité Berlin, University Hospital Zurich, and LMU Munich, providing a robust foundation in medicine.\nPreviously, I dedicated significant efforts to advocacy as the Vice-President for External Affairs of the IFMSA - International Federation of Medical Students\u0026rsquo; Associations, where I championed health issues such as UHC, digital health, and the Sustainable Development Goals committed to advocating on behalf of over 1.5 million medical students worldwide. My work extended to the Austrian Medical Students\u0026rsquo; Union and the Austrian Students\u0026rsquo; Union. Although I have transitioned away from direct advocacy to concentrate on research and innovation, that experience continues to shape my approach to improving healthcare systems and outcomes.\nWhen I find the time, I channel my creativity into web development and maintain a disciplined routine as a passionate runner.
